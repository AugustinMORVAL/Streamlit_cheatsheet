# Streamlit Cheatsheet

## Overview

This Streamlit Cheatsheet is an interactive guide that teaches you how to use Streamlit by using Streamlit itself. It's a comprehensive, hands-on tutorial for learning and mastering Streamlit, an open-source Python library for creating web applications for data science and machine learning projects.

## Learn Streamlit with Streamlit

The unique aspect of this cheatsheet is that it's built entirely with Streamlit, demonstrating the very features it teaches. As you explore each section, you'll see live examples of Streamlit components in action, allowing you to:

- Interact with Streamlit widgets in real-time
- See how different display functions render various types of data
- Experiment with code snippets directly in the app
- Understand how Streamlit's state management works in practice

This approach provides an immersive learning experience, making it easier to grasp Streamlit concepts and immediately apply them to your own projects.
